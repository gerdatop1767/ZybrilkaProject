/**
 * Session-scoped canvas persistence, keyed by taskId (Task Workspace
 * block 4). Deliberately an in-memory module-level Map, not
 * sessionStorage/IndexedDB or a DB table — CLAUDE.md Section 13 asks
 * for "a comfortable digital draft board", never a permanent
 * per-user artifact, and the one hard requirement ("don't lose the
 * drawing on open/close, or when navigating between tasks and back")
 * is fully satisfied by state that survives for the tab's lifetime.
 *
 * Why not plain React state owned by TaskDesktop/TaskMobile: those
 * components remount on every task change (`key={taskId}` — see
 * AppDesktop.tsx/AppMobile.tsx), which would lose task #6's drawing
 * the moment the user opens task #7, even though the spec explicitly
 * requires it to still be there on returning to #6 "пока продолжается
 * текущая Task session". A module-level store keyed by taskId outlives
 * any single mount, so navigating away and back restores it, while
 * `clearCanvasState` (called on a real attempt submission — see
 * TaskDesktop/TaskMobile's handleCheck) gives the "new attempt starts
 * with an empty canvas" boundary the spec also asks for.
